    p.
      The details of my life are quite inconsequential... very well, where do 
      I begin? My father was a relentlessly self-improving boulangerie owner 
      from Belgium with low grade narcolepsy and a penchant for buggery. 
    p.
      My mother was a fifteen year old French prostitute named Chloe with 
      webbed feet.
    p.
      My father would womanize, he would drink. He would make outrageous 
      claims like he invented the question mark. Sometimes he would accuse 
      chestnuts of being lazy. The sort of general malaise that only the 
      genius possess and the insane lament. 
    p.
      My childhood was typical. Summers in Rangoon, luge lessons. In the 
      spring we&rsquo;d make meat helmets.
    p.
      When I was insolent I was placed in a burlap bag and beaten with reeds 
      &mdash; pretty standard really.
    p.
      At the age of twelve I received my first scribe.
    p.
      At the age of fourteen a Zoroastrian named Vilma ritualistically shaved 
      my testicles. There really is nothing like a shorn scrotum... it&rsquo;s 
      breathtaking &mdash; I highly suggest you try it.
