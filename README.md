Supercharge Your Front-End Workflow
===============================================================================

In order to optimise your workflow you need to master the tools to do it right.
In this workshop Jason will introduce the tools that will give you the edge and
teach you how to automate much of your front-end work to allow you to 
concentrate on what truly matters! Whether you're a designer or a developer, 
these tools don't need to be scary and can save you *hours* in the long run.


What You'll Learn
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Sass techniques, including variables, mixins, extends, loops and functions
- Dependency management (without needing to be a back-end developer!)
  - Bower
  - Node
- Using taskrunners for:
  - Sass compilation and minification
  - JavaScript linting
  - CSS auto-prefixing
  - Image compression
  - and more


Requirements
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Node 0.12.0

**NOTE:** This app will most likely work with older versions of Node, but it's 
only been tested on `0.12.0` at this point. Use with older versions of Node at 
your own (low) risk.


Installation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To get this up and running on your computer, start by 
cloning the repo:

    cd path/to/where/you/want/to/install/
    git clone git@github.com:jlengstorf/workshop-supercharge-your-front-end-workflow.git

Next, move into the cloned project and install the 
required dependencies.

    cd ../workshop-supercharge-your-front-end-workflow
    npm install

**NOTE:** [Bower][1] components are automatically installed as a 
[`postinstall` script][2].
